# Simulation and Traffic Routing for Efficient Allocation and Management

This is a simulation project used for modelling the [Braess's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess's_paradox) meant for traffic modelling. It gives an idea on how resources can be added or removed from an existing network in order to increase the overall efficiency of it.

The basis of the paradox relies on the Nash equilibrium that is established in a network when there is a flow of persons who would operate on a selfish or greedy behaviour. This looks at how allocation of resources can modify or impact the overall states of the network and all the users.
This project is a simulation outline of the scenarios possible or encountered when the network is operational and can be modified and extended to cover a greater range of situations where networks may be involved and resources need to be allocated. 

The detailed findings and report can be found in []() and is a small report on testing over a very small network.
