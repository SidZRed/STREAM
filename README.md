# Simulation and Traffic Routing for Efficient Allocation and Management

This is a simulation project used for modelling the [Braess's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess's_paradox) meant for traffic modelling. It gives an idea on how resources can be added or removed from an existing network in order to increase the overall efficiency of it.
